# LightItUp
A hacking solution that help Night-owl and hard working Chinese students gain control at their dorm electricity and bypass enforcement of dorm electricity-off after 23:00.

College Students are one of the most oppressed groups in Chinese universities. They have to study and play in a scheduled Time. For example, dorms in my university would enforce an electicity off at 23:00, making it troublesome for students to stay up late for studying and researching, and of course, entertainment.(i.e. Coin Mining, Train time consuming RNN/DNN models or download huge files overnight).

## Why you make this project?
TBD.

## How does this work?
By digging through the protocals of widly used "Smart Electricity Meters" in China. I found that MITM attack can be performed to bypass the control of Dorm Electricity C&C systems.

## Can I use this in my dorm?
It depends. If your dorm have its own electricity meter inside and you can easily access it without any problem, you may be eiligible to use this solution. Your dorm's electricity meter should be manufactured in China and support DL/T645-2007 protocol.
