A hacking solution that helps Night-owl and hard working Chinese students gain control at their dorm electricity and bypass enforcement of dorm electricity-off after 23:00.

College Students are one of the most oppressed groups in Chinese universities. They have to study and play at a scheduled Time. For example, dorms in my university would enforce an electricity off at 23:00, making it troublesome for students to stay up late for studying and researching, and of course, phone charging and entertainments.(i.e. Coin Mining, Train time-consuming RNN/DNN models or download huge files overnight).

## Why you make this project?
I was training a huge CNN network on my $2000 Workstation in my dorm, I forget about the electricity off and finally found out not only the network is not trained, my computer OS update was broken by the electricity off. I was outraged and started to investigate workarounds. Every student should have the right to study and play at night as long as they don't disturb others.

## How does this work?
By digging through the protocols of widely-used "Smart Electricity Meters" in China. I found that MITM(man-in-the-middle) attack can be performed to bypass the control of Dorm Electricity C&C systems.

This solution includes dangerous hardware modifications and software mods.

## Can I use this in my dorm?
It depends. If your dorm has its own electricity meter inside and you can easily access it without any problem, you may be eligible to use this solution. Your dorm's electricity meter should be manufactured in China and support DL/T645-2007 protocol.
