## Method 1 

Method 1 is very simple and easy, but you need to be careful with timing. Just cut off the communication before the shutdown broadcast, and restore communication when the shutdown broadcast passed. 

Note THAT you MUST NOT forget to restore the communication in 10-45 minutes, you might be in trouble if you forget to turn the switch back on. 

<span style="color:red">It is naive for one to use this method(ie. cut off the signal) to avoid electricity bills update, since the management center will receive alarms if meter's heartbeats has not been seen for some time. If meter lost connection for a long time, say 12 hours), the maintanence team will put your dorm into repair checklist and may get you in trouble. <b>NEVER THINK OF STEALING and PAY YOUR BILL!!!</b></span>

## Setup:

1. Open the power cabinet, find the meter and unscrew its case.
2. Find 2 signal cables. These two cables are usually soft, different with the power cable below and not in connection with the switches.

3. Add a switch. Connect the original cables to one side of the switch and use two cables you prepared to connect with the electric meter.
4. Open the switch normally.
5. Clean up and close the cabinet.

## Steps:

On the first night, you SHOULD NOT cut off the switch. In order to make sure the connection is good, you should let the power off as usual. Please also take note of the time when power off, so you can cut the connection off before the broadcast is sent tomorrow.

On the second night before the power off time, you should cut off the connection and wait until the other dorm's power was out, then you MUST turn the switch back on to let electricity meter continue sending the heartbeat. 

Remember, if you missed the power off signal and your dorm has been switching off, there is NO WAY to turn the dorm back on, until tomorrow 6:00 am when the power on instructions is sent to every dorm's meter.

Note that if you still forgot to turn the switch back on until 6:00 am when you still got blackout, you will HAVE TO wait until TOMORROW. You must avoid this since if your dorm's meter lost connection for a long time, the maintanence team will put your dorm into repair checklist and may get you in trouble.
